# Sorting Visualiser

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This interactive web application provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms in action. Witness the step-by-step sorting process and compare the efficiency of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and more.


## Demo

## Key Features
* Interactive Visualization: Watch as the sorting algorithms rearrange elements in real-time, providing a clear visual understanding of their functionality.
* Algorithm Selection: Choose from a range of sorting algorithms to compare their performance and behavior.
* Speed Control: Adjust the visualization speed to suit your preferences, allowing for detailed observation or quick overviews.
* Array Size Customization: Modify the input array size to observe how algorithms handle different input sizes.

## Motivation
I created this Sorting Visualizer project as a means to learn and practice React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By working on this project, I aimed to enhance my understanding of React's core concepts and improve my skills in developing interactive web applications.
